# Auto-Correct

## Practice Quiz

### Question 1

The minimum edit distance between the words *deep* and *creepy* is:

Answer: $4$

Explanation: You need to replace d for c, which counts for 2, insert r and insert y.

### Question 2

Which of the following is a NOT VALID example of an edit string operation?

- INSERT a letter: 'aple' --> 'apple'
- DELETE a letter: 'cloack'  -->  'cloak'
- SWITCH a letter 'Lusca' --> 'Lucas'
- REPLACE a letter 'Crayom' --> 'Crayon'

Answer: C

Explanation: Switching a letter is a valid operation ONLY when switching adjacent letters! In this case there were two switches: switch s and c and after s and a.

### Question 3

Autocorrect is only appliable when dealing with misspelled words.

- False
- True

Answer: A

Explanation: Autocorrect can also be used for words that does not make any sense for a particular sentence. For instance, "Happy birthday deer friends" is a correct spelled sentence, but the word 'deer' makes no sense â€“ it should be dear.

### Question 4

Given the corpus:

"I am happy because I am doing quizzes."

Based on this tiny corpus, consider the following sentence:

"I **sm** very good at solving quizzes."

Which of the following is true?

- It is not possible to decide a correction for the misspelled word "sm".
- There is a unique correction for the misspelled word "sm".
- There is more than one possible candidate for a correction to the misspelled word "sm".
- The corpus is too tiny, so it is not possible to build a probabilistic model for autocorrection.

Answer: B

Explanation: The correction would be the word "am".

### Question 5

About the probabilistic model defined in the lecture, select all that apply.

- Words with the same probability in the corpus will be equally likely to be candidates for a possible word correction.
- Replacing a character costs more than deleting a character.
- If $C(w)$ is the number of times a word appear in a corpus and $V$ is the corpus size, then the probability of the word $w$ in the corpus is $P(w) = \frac{C(w)}{V}$.
- The sentence "Happy birthday deer friends" would not have any word corrected in the model defined in the lecture.

Answer: BCD

Explanation:

Replacing a word costs 2 whereas deleting it costs 1.

Since the model just looks at misspelled words, the above sentence would not be corrected.

### Question 6

Suppose we build a distance matrix $D$ for the following case:

Source: Pie --> Target: Bye

What is the value for $D[3, 2]$?

Answer: $5$

### Question 7

About the Minimum edit distance algorithm, select all that apply. Let $D$ be the distance matrix, for two words of same size. The matrix size is $n$.

- $D[0, i] > D[0, j]$, if $i > j$.
- $D[n, n]$ stores the highest value in the matrix.
- $D[i, j] = min(D[i - 1, j] + delCost, D[i, j - 1] + insCost, D[i - 1, j - 1] + repCost)$
- The algorithm avoids usage of brute force by implementing a dynamic programming approach.

Answer: AD

Explanation:

The first line will always have increasing values as we move to the right because it is the cost from editing the null string.

Using previous computed cells to compute another one is a dynamic programming method.

### Question 8

About the minimum edit distance, which of the following statement is not true?

- It is used to evaluate similarity between two strings.
- It is used to check if a word is misspelled.
- It counts the minimum number of edits to transform one string into another.
- It is used to implement spelling correction, document similarity and machine translation.

Answer: B

Explanation: It is a measure between two strings and not a method to decide if a string is misspelled or not.

### Question 9

The minimum edit distance calculation is more computationally intensive if we have a big corpus.

- True
- False

Answer: B

Explanation: The minimum edit distance depends only on the editing cost and the two words that are being considered and not on any corpus or vocabulary.

### Question 10

Given the corpus "Autocorrect is a powerful tool and it is used on our computer."

The value for $P(\text{is})$ is:

The answer should have two decimal places (rounding up, if necessary). For example: $0.88888$ should be answered as $0.89$.

Answer: 0.17

Explanation: $P(\text{is}) = \frac{2}{12}$
